# RPS
rock,paper,&amp;scissors .bat file

This bat file was created when I was working on my Intro to Operation System & Scripts class, and the objective was to make an RPS program using the .bat extenstion. After completing this task and a couple of minutes of assitance on fixing a couple of bugs, the assignment was completed and turned in.

So I have decided to make this end result public for you to play around with, or to perhaps upgrade it, if you so please to do so. So yeah have fun with this program, and have a wonderful day.
